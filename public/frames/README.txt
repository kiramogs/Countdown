PLEASE READ:
To enable the scroll animation, place your image sequence frames in this folder.
- Format: JPEG or PNG
- Naming: frame_0001.jpg, frame_0002.jpg, ... frame_0100.jpg
- Recommended count: 50-200 frames for a smooth scroll.
- Ensure the images are optimized for web (1920x1080, compressed).

The application is configured to look for files named "frame_[number].jpg" starting from 1.
You can adjust the total frame count in `src/components/HeroSequence.jsx` if needed.
